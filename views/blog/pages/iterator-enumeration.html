<p><strong>Both interfaces</strong>Â provide traverse the collection and fetch objects from it.
<p><strong>But</strong>, there are 2 differences between Iterator and Enumeration interface.</p>

<h3>1.Iterator has remove() method which can delete the current node while traversing the collection.</h3>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript" prism>
        public interface Iterator {
           public boolean hasNext();
           public Object next();
           public void remove();
        }
    </code>
</pre>

<p><strong>Enumeration</strong> interface doesnt have this method. Enumeration acts as Read-Only interface.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript" prism>
        public interface Enumeration {
           public boolean hasMoreElements();
           public Object nextElement();
        }
    </code>
</pre>

<h3>2. Iterator is more secure and safe compared with Enumeration interface. </h3>

<p>Iterator doesnt allow multiple threads modify the collection at the same time. Therefore, ConcurrentModificationException is not thrown while traversing the collection through the use of Iterator interface.
    Whereas <strong>Enumeration</strong> interface cannot provide this feature. Enumeration is not thread-safe interface. </p>
